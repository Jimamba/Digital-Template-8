<h2>Race to 21</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A luck-based indirect-control based game, where two players try to get to 21 before the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience goal I was aiming for is to give players a sense of importance when it comes to timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Indirect control, 1v1 competition.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The controls are simple, each player has a turn. They must time when to stop the cycle of numbers, in order to get a certain
number of points. To pause the timer they must press S. Unfortunately, I don't think I got this to work right. The reason the game
is so simplistic in it's control and design, is because we were supposed to make a game that's different from what we usually make.
Since most of my games involve total control over the character/main gameplay points, I had to make a game with the least amount
of player control as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Indirect-Control, Luck-Based/Reaction-time based gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It's so far my only indirect control styled game, and it requires a good reaction time for the player to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is not setting or premise.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no story either.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People that like to compete against each other without complex rules.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Approximately 15 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing and carefully watching the cycle of numbers.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all of these assets myself, EXCEPT for the music.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I don't think this game is close to any of my previous prototypes.
